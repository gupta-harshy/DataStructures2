Bus Ticket booking system 
1. Search the routes (point A, point B, date) --- high traffic
2. Available seats on those routes (bus number, date)
3. Book the tickets (bus Id, seat No, Date )

Architecture:
1. location information. --> geohash --> redis --> location --> 2 servers --> circuit breaker pattern 
Indian operstions -> we would divide India, which would area blocks -> 2000km2
2k/0.5k - 4M blocks -> 10bytes * => 40MB + 40MB => 80MB


2. Bus informations which bus on which route --> SQL  busNumber, location;
redis -> for faster acces; each day update happens with some backend job

SQL -->  busNumber, seatNumber, IsBooked, date 


3. Seat numbers and bookings --> SQL transcactions.
